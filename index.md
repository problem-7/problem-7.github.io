# Problem 7

<p class = intro>
	In a whimsical land of candy canes, let $x$ be the number of jellyfish that can play chess on a giant pizza. If each jellyfish can only strategize when the number of chess pieces equals the cube of the number of flying waffles $w$, determine the total number of chess matches $M$. Every match adds a giggle if at least one jellyfish is wearing a hat made of whipped cream. If possible, express $M$ in terms of $x$ and $w$; if not, respond with “syrup rainbows.”
