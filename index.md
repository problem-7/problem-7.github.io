# Problem 7
<!-- ## Your usual Mathematical Olympiad but totally different  -->
<script src="assets/js/gen.js"></script>
<p class = intro>
	<span class = "gen-land"></span>, <span class = "playerA"></span> and <span class = "playerB"></span> are playing a <span class = "gen-adj"></span> game. Whenever <span class = "playerA"></span> <span class = "gen-act"></span>, <span class = "playerB"></span> in turn <span class = "gen-act"></span>. If at any point <span class = "playerA"></span> repeatedly <span class = "gen-act"></span>, <span class = "playerB"></span> immediately <span class = "gen-act"></span>. Whoever first <span class = "gen-act"></span> wins the game. Assuming that <span class = "playerB"></span> never <span class = "gen-act"></span>, determine who has a winning strategy.

## What's this about?
<blockquote>
	To ask the 'right' question is far more important than to receive the answer. The solution of a problem lies in the understanding of the problem; the answer is not outside the problem, it is in the problem.

We love beautiful problems, you love beautiful problems, who doesn't love beautiful problems? Mathematical Olympiads are all about tackling some of the most elegant and interesting conundrums that anyone who has done maths at school can enjoy. But where do all these amazing problems come from? Do they grow on trees? Are they dropped in by a storch? Maybe you've already tried to cook up your own freaky inequality, outrageous Diophantine equation, intricate geometry puzzle, or wondered what happens if Alice and Bob battle it out in a cooking contest. It suffices to say that coming up with problems for Mathematical Olympiads is a delicate, challenging, and increadibly creative endevour. At *Problem 7*, we pass the torch to you: we want to see your most original and magical problem creations!

## Aight, so how does it work?

Put simply, *Problem 7* is a beauty contest for original Mathematical Olympiad problems. The competition is open to anyone â€“ students, undergrads, postdocs and Fields medallists are all equally welcome. Problems are submited online by you, the participants, during a designeted timeframe. The problems are then judged by an independent Jury panel on several criteria, which are outlined in more detail below. After the grading period, the winning problems will be published in the form of an exam for everyone to enjoy. There will also be some special prizes that will be announced later on.


## So how do I win?

	I was able to solve problems 1 and 5. Problem 4 was geometry, which I don't like. Number 6 had many variables: I'll be surprised if even the big teams solved it.

For a problem to be considered a *great* problem, it must rank high in sevaral aspects. Initially, the problem statement must have a certain level of **elegance**, enticing the reader to approach. A great problem further requires **originality**, it must be different from problems the reader has seen before. Then, it must have a certain **depth**, inviting multiple angles of attack and thus making the problem solving process exciting. Finally, the solution of a great problem must exhibit **beauty** in using a clever trick, key idea, insight, or combination of observations, without too much nitty gritty technical work.

Each submition will thus be judged by multiple jurors on these four categories of elegance, orginality, depth and beauty. This is of course a highyl subjective process, not something matheamticians are generally very fond of, but I guess you'll just have to deal with that. Also note that we do nt cnsider the difficulty of the problems. There are great problems on all levels of difficulty, and some of the greatest problems are very accessible to beginners with little Olympiad experience. We do however ask that the problems submitted are **not too difficult**, in particular they should not exceed your avarage IMO problem 2 in difficulty. The reason for this is that we want to guarantee a wide range of meaningful feedback from jurors within the limited timeframe. Problem submitions on all permissible levels are encouraged, with winners chosen to cover a wide range of difficulty.

Convinced? Here's what you need to make a submition:
- A problem statament that adheres with the **submition criteria and rules** (see next section), written in plain LaTeX. Note that for the problem statement, the **presentation matters**! A great problem is so much more than just its mathematical content...

- A PDF file containing as many (at least one!) solutions to the problem known to you. This will not be considered directly when judging your problem, its sole purpose is to make ensure we don't miss a beautiful intended solution! Hence, presentation here is secondary to centent, but of course it does not hurt to put in some effort...

While quite boring, rules are important! Please read them carefully and adhere to them, we trust you to play fair.

Timeline

Submition Rules
- Problems and intended solutions should follow the style and syllabus of Mathematical Olympiads.
- Problems shoud not be harder than a usual problem 2 at the International Mathematical Olympiad.
- Problems and solutions must be written in English.
- Problems must only be submitted by their author.
- All co-authors, contributors and direct inspirations must be credited.
- Problems must not have appeared publically before, including on contests and public forums.
- Problems must not be submitted to other contests until the end of the competition.
- Each author may submit at most three problems. If exeeded, only the first three submitions will be considered.
- Problems must not use highly inappropriate language. 
- Problems must not be incomplete or have major flaws. Minor flaws and typos will be ajusted.

Publishing Rules
- Problems which are awarded a prize will be published, with authors duely credited
- Minor changes might be made to published problems to fix typos and ensure coherent style
- Problems that are not awarded a prize will be kept confidential indefinitely
- Submited solutions will not be published
- Personal data will not be shared with third parties

Jury Conditions
- Members of the jury may also make submitions, but will not rate their own submitions.
- Members of the jury must all be associated with a national Mathematical Olympiad program.
